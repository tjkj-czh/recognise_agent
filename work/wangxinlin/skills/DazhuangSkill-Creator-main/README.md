![Dazhuang Skill Creator benchmark overview](assets/benchmark-overview.png)

> Official original = Claude Code's official `skill-creator`  
> `My Skill Creator Copy` = my second iteration  
> `Dazhuang Skill Creator` = the final version in this repo

Dazhuang Skill Creator starts from Claude Code's official `skill-creator`, then rebuilds it with a stronger view of prompt architecture, skill architecture, and how CLI tool execution actually behaves in real usage.

This is not just a wording tweak. I reworked the workflow, structure, bundled resources, and maintenance model so the generated skill is easier to evolve, easier to debug, and easier to collaborate on over time.

> Update `v1.5.0` (2026-04-11): this major memory release introduces memory modes (`off` / `adaptive` / `lessons` / `auto`), lesson-to-hard-rule promotion, stricter memory invariants in `quick_validate.py`, and regression coverage for no-rehire behavior.
> Update `v1.5.2` (2026-04-11): memory judgment is now a required step during scaffold creation; if `auto` is used without `--intent` and it currently falls to `off`, initialization pauses and asks for explicit intent or explicit mode.
> Update `v1.5.3` (2026-04-11): onboarding friction is reduced. `init_skill.py` now prints copy-ready fixes when `--path` is missing, and `quick_validate.py` now prints copy-ready Step 4 event lines when memory commands are missing.
> Update `v1.5.4` (2026-04-11): fixed three real flow pain points: no more default pointers to missing `references/examples.md`; `quick_validate.py` now supports `--strict` (and packaging uses strict checks by default); memory-judgment wording is now dynamic so explicit modes do not look like re-classification.
> Update `v1.5.5` (2026-04-11): fixed fenced-code heading parsing in `quick_validate.py`; selecting `--resources assets` now always scaffolds `assets/output-format.md`; report/review/table-like tasks now get earlier assets-path guidance during init.
> Update `v1.5.6` (2026-04-11): clarified auto-mode resource completion (`lessons/adaptive` always auto-add `references/` + `scripts/`), and fixed throttled update checks so stale cached versions are no longer shown as `latest`.
> Update `v1.5.7` (2026-04-11): the evaluation flow now stops to align the judging standard first. You write an "evaluation proposal" first, then a "formal evaluation plan"; without that plan, benchmark and review now stop by default.
> Update `v1.5.8` (2026-04-11): multi-skill benchmark summaries now show every config, not just the first two; benchmark aggregation now hard-checks eval-to-dimension coverage against the evaluation plan; review also shows required report sections and dimension mapping.
> Update `v1.5.9` (2026-04-11): fixed the big evaluation-entry bug. The first response to any skill-evaluation request must now stop at the alignment proposal; no direct scoring, no direct A/B run, and no direct benchmark before the user confirms the judging scheme.

For evaluation, I used Codex in headless mode - no GUI, no need to open the CLI page, just terminal execution - and ran at least 3 independent conversation tests per benchmark item. The full benchmark standards and archived reports are included in `测评报告/`.

## What Was Benchmarked

### 1. Five task-type capability comparisons

- A | Content creation - whether prompts, templates, and platform style can be organized into reusable skills
- B | Structured output - whether the skill can follow a strict JSON schema and keep the output stable
- C | Tool research - whether it reads source files, cites evidence, and avoids hand-wavy summaries
- D | Script execution - whether the generated scripts actually run and fail safely when needed
- E | Hybrid orchestration - whether prompt, reference, asset, and script layers work together coherently

### 2. Five capability archetype comparisons

- Minimal compressed output
- Strict structured output
- Safety judgment
- Template-based abstraction
- Dirty-input normalization

## Evaluation Method

- Benchmarks were run with Codex headless mode in the terminal
- Each case was tested with at least 3 independent conversations
- The 3-version capability-archetype benchmark compared:
  - Claude Code official `skill-creator`
  - `My Skill Creator Copy` as the second iteration
  - `Dazhuang Skill Creator` as the final version
- The archived reports include:
  - `45 creation runs + 15 baselines` for the 3-version benchmark
  - `30 creation runs + 15 baselines` for the head-to-head task-type benchmark
- Source directory integrity checks remained clean during benchmarking (`manifest diff = 0`)

## Evaluation Dimensions

The benchmark scoring rolls up into five top-level dimensions:

- Process efficiency
- Precision
- Product quality
- Actual-use effect
- Stability

## Results

### Overall conclusion

- `Dazhuang Skill Creator` ranks first in both benchmark sets archived in this repo
- In the 3-version capability-archetype benchmark, the final version wins with a total score of `99.43`
- In the head-to-head task-type benchmark, the final version beats the official original with a total score of `99.44` vs `96.20`
- The result is a clear overall win, but not a "crushing" win according to the benchmark's own verdict rule

### 3-version capability-archetype benchmark

| Version | Total | Actual Use | Process | Precision | Quality | Stability |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Dazhuang Skill Creator | 99.43 | 98.64 | 100.00 | 99.53 | 100.00 | 100.00 |
| My Skill Creator Copy | 87.84 | 94.60 | 84.25 | 97.55 | 94.39 | 0.00 |
| Claude Code official `skill-creator` | 87.22 | 98.06 | 77.18 | 100.00 | 90.72 | 0.00 |

Key takeaways:

- Final version leads the runner-up by `11.59` points
- Final version achieves `100.0` downstream semantic accuracy in this benchmark set
- Final version is also the smallest of the three by average skill size (`4,290` bytes vs `7,063` and `6,613`)

### 5 task-type benchmark: final version vs official original

| Task Type | Official | Dazhuang | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| A - Content creation | 100.00 | 100.00 | Tie |
| B - Structured output | 100.00 | 100.00 | Tie |
| C - Tool research | 98.89 | 100.00 | Dazhuang leads |
| D - Script execution | 100.00 | 100.00 | Tie |
| E - Hybrid orchestration | 83.72 | 83.82 | Dazhuang leads slightly |

Additional head-to-head results:

- Total score: `99.44` vs `96.20`
- Actual-use effect: `100.00` vs `98.08`
- Process efficiency: `97.74` vs `89.37`
- Downstream semantic accuracy: `96.76` vs `96.52`
- Runtime validation: both versions scored `100.0`

## Why This Version Is Easier To Maintain

Compared with the original version, this repo puts more emphasis on maintainable structure:

- Keep the main `SKILL.md` centered on durable rules and workflow
- Keep single-file skills inside a fixed section whitelist: `角色`, `规则`, `工作流程`, `例子`, `输出格式`, `索引`
- Treat `例子` as model-facing internal references, not user prompt examples; treat `输出格式` as model-facing templates
- Push long explanations into `references/`
- Put reusable templates into `assets/`
- Put deterministic or repetitive work into `scripts/`
- Keep frequently adjusted defaults in `config.yaml`

That makes follow-up iteration much easier. The original version can become hard to modify once generated, while this version is designed to remain editable and team-friendly over time.

## Default Strategy For Existing Skills

This repo no longer treats "optimize an existing skill" as "just tweak the `description`", and it does not treat refactoring as a separate methodology either.

- Creation and refactoring follow the same blueprint; the difference is whether you start from scratch or reorganize material from an old skill
- First diagnose whether the real issue is triggering, structure, or both
- If the old skill is bloated, scattered, or easy to derail across long contexts, default to structural refactoring so it realigns with the Dazhuang architecture
- Only run trigger eval / description optimization after the skill body itself is structurally sound
- The goal is alignment with the same blueprint, not mechanically forcing every skill into the same template; simple skills can still stay single-file

## Project Structure

- `SKILL.md` - the final Dazhuang Skill Creator skill definition
- `VERSION` - the local creator version marker used by the runtime update check
- `agents/` - benchmark and comparison agent prompts
- `references/` - architecture notes, evaluation workflow, packaging guidance, internal examples, and schemas
- `assets/` - model-facing templates, reusable assets, and report templates
- `scripts/` - initialization, validation, update checking, evaluation, optimization, reporting, and packaging tools
- `config.yaml` - editable defaults for init, update checking, evaluation, optimization, and packaging
- `测评报告/` - archived benchmark reports and screenshots

## Quick Start

### Install into a Claude Code / Codex / Open Claude skill directory

The recommended install path is `git clone`, because runtime update checks and auto-update both rely on a real git working tree.

```bash
cd <your-skill-dir>
git clone https://github.com/DazhuangJammy/DazhuangSkill-Creator.git
```

If you ask another AI to install this repo for you, be explicit:

- use `git clone https://github.com/DazhuangJammy/DazhuangSkill-Creator.git`
- do not just download a zip
- do not just copy the folder contents
- do not remove `.git`

Standard prompt for Claude / Codex / other installation-oriented AIs:

```text
Please install this skill into my skill directory, and you must use git clone.

Repository:
https://github.com/DazhuangJammy/DazhuangSkill-Creator.git

Requirements:
1. Use git clone, not a zip download
2. Do not just copy the folder contents
3. Keep the .git directory intact
4. Confirm the installed directory is a normal git working tree
5. If the target directory already exists, tell me first before deciding whether to pull or reinstall
```

### Create a new skill scaffold

On Windows, replace `python3` with `py -3` (preferred) or `python`.

One easy-to-miss point:

- `--path` is not optional in practice. If you do not pass `--path`, you must set `init_skill.output_path` in `config.yaml` first.
- For first-run success, explicitly pass `--path ./out`, then move it into config later if you want.

```bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path ./out --memory-mode auto --intent "low-risk deterministic task"
```

If a single-file skill needs extra inline modules, declare them explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py my-judge-skill --path ./out --sections role,output-format --memory-mode auto --intent "boundary-heavy review task"
```

If you want `references/examples.md` to be created on day one, add `--examples`.
Without `--examples`, that file is not created and the scaffold will not force a pointer to it.
If you enable `--resources assets`, the scaffold now always creates `assets/output-format.md` (independent of `--examples`).

Memory modes:

- `off`: no memory layer
- `lessons`: enable memory pipeline from day one (`memory-state` + `memory-events` + `memory-lessons`)
- `adaptive`: start without memory, then auto-enable after repeated runtime friction
- `auto` (default): classify before scaffold creation and choose `off` / `adaptive` / `lessons`
- Resource auto-completion: if the resolved mode is `lessons` or `adaptive`, init will auto-add `references/` and `scripts/` even when they are not explicitly listed in `--resources`.

Memory-layer judgment is a required step:

- Always decide whether memory is needed, even if the final mode is `off`.
- Recommended default: `--memory-mode auto --intent "<task semantics>"`.
- If you manually choose `off`, include a one-line reason (for example: low risk, low variability, deterministic flow).

These `memory_*` settings in `config.yaml` are scaffold defaults for generated skills only; they do not turn on memory for this creator repo itself.

If you want to force memory from day one, enable lessons mode:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py my-review-skill --path ./out --memory-mode lessons
```

If you want pre-creation auto-classification, provide intent text:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py my-analysis-skill --path ./out --memory-mode auto --intent "high-variance analysis with iterative refinement"
```

If you want runtime auto-enable, use adaptive mode:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py my-analysis-skill --path ./out --memory-mode adaptive
```

Both `lessons` and `adaptive` add `scripts/memory_mode_guard.py`, `references/memory-state.json`, and `references/memory-events.jsonl`.

- `lessons`: starts with memory enabled; repeated failure signatures are promoted into lessons.
- `adaptive`: starts disabled; reaches thresholds, then auto-enables lessons.
- In both modes, stable lessons are promoted into a `MEMORY_HARD_RULES` block inside generated `SKILL.md`.
- Safety rail: if the final setting ends up as `memory_mode=off` (via CLI or config) while auto-classification suggests memory should be enabled, initialization now blocks by default. Use `--force-memory-off` only when you truly want to override it.
- New rail: if you use `memory_mode=auto` without `--intent` and auto currently falls to `off`, initialization now pauses and asks you to either provide intent or choose a mode explicitly.

### Validate a skill

```bash
python3 scripts/quick_validate.py ./out/my-skill
```

`quick_validate.py` now also enforces memory-skill invariants (when memory files are detected): `MEMORY_HARD_RULES` markers, Step 1/Step 4 guard commands, and required memory runtime files.
For pre-release checks, use strict mode:

```bash
python3 scripts/quick_validate.py ./out/my-skill --strict
```

Strict mode additionally blocks `TODO` / `TBD` / placeholder markers and requires non-empty frontmatter `description`.
`package_skill.py` now runs strict validation by default before packaging.

If it reports missing Step 4 retry/failure event commands, add these lines inside Step 4 of the target skill:

```text
<python-cmd> "<skill-base>/scripts/memory_mode_guard.py" --skill-dir "<skill-base>" --event retry
<python-cmd> "<skill-base>/scripts/memory_mode_guard.py" --skill-dir "<skill-base>" --event failure
```

### Manually check creator updates

```bash
python3 scripts/check_update.py --force
```

### Refactor an existing skill

- The refactor still follows the same blueprint used for new skills; it just starts by extracting what is worth keeping from the old skill
- First classify the intervention level as `light optimization`, `structural refactor`, or `full overhaul`
- If the problem is structural bloat, path drift, or losing the main line in long contexts, refactor `SKILL.md` and rebalance `references/`, `assets/`, and `scripts/` first
- Only move on to the trigger workflow after the structure is stable

### Evaluate whether a skill actually got better

The default path is now split into two layers. Do not start by writing eval prompts immediately:

1. align the judging standard first
2. then run the execution-side evaluation

Hard gate:

- if the user just said "evaluate this skill", "test with vs without", or "compare these skills", the first response must stop at the alignment proposal
- do not jump straight to scoring, A/B results, benchmark, or winner selection before the user confirms the plan

Planning entry points:

- `references/eval-planning.md`
- `assets/evaluation-alignment-script.md`
- `assets/evaluation-proposal-template.md`
- `assets/evaluation-plan-template.md`

Execution entry points:

- `references/eval-loop.md`
- `references/schemas.md`

Recommended order:

1. write the "evaluation proposal" with `assets/evaluation-proposal-template.md`
2. if you need a ready-made talk track, start from `assets/evaluation-alignment-script.md`
3. align primary direction, secondary direction, weights, dimensions, and out-of-scope items with the human
4. write the "formal evaluation plan" with `assets/evaluation-plan-template.md`
5. save it as `evals/eval-plan.json`
6. tag each eval's `eval_metadata.json` with `dimension_ids` / `dimension_labels`
7. run benchmark aggregation
8. generate both `review.html` and `report.html`
9. only then ask the user to read results or make a call

Benchmark and the final HTML artifacts now check for that plan by default:

```bash
python3 scripts/aggregate_benchmark.py ./workspace/iteration-1 --skill-path ./out/my-skill --eval-plan ./out/my-skill/evals/eval-plan.json
python3 scripts/generate_eval_artifacts.py ./workspace/iteration-1 --benchmark ./workspace/iteration-1/benchmark.json --eval-plan ./out/my-skill/evals/eval-plan.json
```

Formal evaluation is only considered complete when both files exist:

- `review.html`: the base evidence workbench
- `report.html`: the human-friendly full report with plan, prompts, answers, scoring, and conclusion

Even if someone directly runs `generate_review.py` or `generate_report.py`, the script now auto-generates the companion HTML by default; if that second file cannot be created, the first file is rolled back and the command fails.

Only use this for old archived results:

- `--allow-missing-eval-plan`

Once a plan exists, benchmark aggregation also hard-checks:

- every eval is tagged with plan-aligned dimensions
- no eval points to dimensions that are not in the plan
- the plan's key dimensions are actually covered by the eval set

If you compare `skill_a / skill_b / skill_c`, benchmark markdown and review now render all configs instead of collapsing to only two columns.

### Evaluate triggering behavior

This is **trigger eval only**, not the main path for output-quality or delivery-effect evaluation:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_eval.py --eval-set ./path/to/eval-set.json --skill-path ./out/my-skill
```

### Run the optimization loop

Use this only after the skill body is already structurally sound and you are optimizing **trigger behavior**:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_loop.py --eval-set ./path/to/eval-set.json --skill-path ./out/my-skill
```

### Package a skill

```bash
python3 scripts/package_skill.py ./out/my-skill ./dist
```

## Runtime Update Check

This repo now ships with a lightweight self-update path that hangs off Step 1 of the creator skill:

- Recommended source: `https://github.com/DazhuangJammy/DazhuangSkill-Creator.git`
- Recommended install mode: `git clone` into the target skill directory
- Every real invocation of the skill starts by running `scripts/check_update.py`
- By default it checks the network at most once every `24` hours
- In throttled mode, JSON exposes the cached remote value as `cached_remote_version`; `latest_version` is no longer downgraded to an older cached value than local
- When a new version is found, it reminds once, then stays quiet until an even newer version appears
- The default config already enables `update_check.auto_update: true`; as long as the current install is a clean git clone, the script will try `git pull --ff-only`
- If the skill was installed by manually copying the folder, or the working tree has local edits, the script falls back to reminder-only mode
- Even after a successful auto-update, the refreshed files fully apply on the next invocation of the skill; the current run continues with the already loaded version

Minimal config:

```yaml
update_check:
  enabled: true
  interval_hours: 24
  auto_update: true
```

If you prefer to disable auto-update explicitly:

```yaml
update_check:
  enabled: true
  auto_update: false
  interval_hours: 24
```
